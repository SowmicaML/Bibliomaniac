                You really don’t have to worry about this fact. With all the different reading material in the world, I doubt this is even possible.

                2. The world’s smallest book is Teeny Ted from Turnip Town.
                This book is now the worlds smallest and it is verified by The Guiness Book of Records.  The book is in production and measures 100 micrometers by 70 micrometers. It has an ISBN number too – 978-1-894897-17-4.

                3. There are four law books bound in human skin at the Harvard University Library.
                This is a very interesting fact. Anthropodermic bibliopegy is the term given to binding books in human skin. There are actually several books known to be bound in human skin. Interestingly it was mainly doctors who bound these books. There are also several books bound in animal skin.

                4.  Fact has it that former American President Theodore Roosevelt read one book a day.
                An interesting fact for sure, with todays distractions we would find it difficult to read this much. There are plenty of people that read a lot of books in a week but one day is an achievement. The fact is, reading every day can reduce your stress levels and help with depression.

                5. People say the longest sentence to ever be printed in literature belongs to Victor Hugo. The claim is that in Les Misérables there is a sentence which is 823 words long.
                This is the longest fact we have on our list. I dont think a blog post would work very well with sentances this long. We actually managed to find a version of the sentance, the one we found is 805 words. You can read it here – Longest Sentence.

                6. 1 in 5 adults around the world cannot read or write.
               This fact is a little sad. In the western world we take for granted our education system and sometimes forget about the people in the less privilaged parts.
               This fact has lead us on to finding out about School Aid. They are a charity providing sustainable literacy development for children and young people in Africa. If you have a spare few minutes give their website a read.

               7. Up to 50 books can be made from 1 tree.
                We love this fact. Being sustainable is a massive part of our day-to-day lives and being able to make up to 50 books from one tree is fantastic especially with printing companies using fully sustainable paper. Also a new movement on youtube is trying to plant 20 million trees.

                 8. Copies of pulped Mills and Boon novels were used to build part of the M6 toll road.
                The M6 toll road is in Birmingam, UK. It is 26 miles of a 6 lane motorway. 2.5 million copies of Mills and Boon novels were acquired and then pulped at a recycling firm in South Wales, UK. They were used in the top layer of the motorway.

                9. The most expensive book in the world is Codex Leicester by Leonardo Da Vinci. It was purchased by Bill Gates for 30.8 million dollars.
            This is the most expensive book fact in the world.
            Bill Gates purchased the Codex Leicester in 1994 for $30.8 million. When you add inflation to that the book would cost $53.3 million. If Bill Gates were to sell this book today we reckon the book would sell for a lot more.

            10. In America, the most banned books are Harry Potter. The apparent reasons are because they promote witchcraft, they set bad examples and are too dark.
Harry Potter Series
Most of the books have been banned in catholic schools as they contain ‘real’ spells. It is also said that the Harry Potter series presents witchcraft and wizardry in a good light which is simply not true.
I have yet to be able to use a spell successfully, perhaps it’s my technique?
